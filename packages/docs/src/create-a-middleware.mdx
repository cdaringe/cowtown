# create a piece of middleware

the koa docs already cover this full well, but it's worth a quick review.
most work in koa applications happen in middlewares.  your application exists
to do work, and a request/response `context` flows up and down a stack of
middlewares.

middleware is easy to write, and should be considered often when designing a workflow.

**a middleware is just function. let's make one.**

```typescript
// babys-first-middleware/server.js
const loggerMiddleware: Middleware<any> = async (ctx, next) => {
  console.log('started')
  await next() // runs the next middleware
  console.log('finished')
}
// curl localhost:3000 # logs:
// started
// finished
```

**typescript buff?**

```typescript
type Middleware<T> =
  (context: T, next: () => Promise<any>) => any;

// don't know typescript?  dont sweat it.
// this statment says that a middleware is a function
// that takes two arguments--a context,
// and another function called `next`
```
