# gracefully update configuration

it may be the case that you do _not_ wish to teardown your service simply to swap
configuration data. if your application has requests inflight, swapping shared, mutable configuration whilst
outstanding handlers are in proccess may introduce nondeteriminstic or fatal behavior.

if your application needs to swap config at runtime, try to handle these changes
gracefully.  i recommend either:

- gracefully restarting the server on receipt of new configuration _in process_, or
- maintaining a stack of immutable configs, only of which one is attached to a request through its lifecycle

in the latter option, when an older configuration object is no longer consumed by any outstanding requests,
it can be `shift`ed off of the stack.  the later option also assumes that middlewares
can functionl using configuration from of the request context alone.  if this is not the
case, fall back to the first option.
