# isomorphic rendering

## overview

isomorphic rendering, whilst considered an advanced concept, is conceptually simple.
the objective is to render a complete html page when a user requests your website, such that
they may begin viewing content immediately. once the page loads, the interactive
web-application experience downloads and instantiates itself, asyncronously.
the final result is that user gets content faster, as hence perceives your application to
be faster.

there are many technology stacks, front-end and back-end, that enable this workflow.
this particular demonstration uses:

- [react](https://reactjs.org) & [redux](https://redux.js.org) for the ui application
- [koa-parcel-middleware](https://www.npmjs.com/package/koa-parcel-middleware) for integrating the ui application with the server
- `koa` for our server

## strategy

- create a ui application bundler instance.
    - in this case, we will use parcel's bundler.  why do you need a bundler?  [webpack's doc cover this well](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/why-webpack/)
- create a static asset middleware for serving ui assets (images, css files, etc)
- create a parcel middleware _using the bundler instance_ and the static fileserver middleware
    - this will compile your ui and serve it to browsers on request
- register the middleware.

## demonstration

the web-application by default starts with minimal state.
it's a basic counter app starting with the `count` at `0`. however,
you will see that when using server-side rendering, we provide an `initialState` where
the count is equal to `99`.  because we rendered a react app with `count === 99`, the
resultant html shows 99 to the user immediately.  once the javascript finishes
downloading in the background, the increment/decrement buttons work starting from 99, because we `hydrate`d
the react app with the same initial state (see `window.INITIAL_STATE`)!


> isomorphic react redux app

```html
<!--
  react-redux-app/index.html
  parcel _and_ our parcel middleware will use this html
  template. note that parcel wants src=app.tsx as an
  entrypoint, which of course isn't a valid js file ;)
-->
<html>
<head>
  <title>react-redux ssr demo</title>
  <!-- head-content -->
</head>
  <div id="app"><!-- ssr-content --></div>
  <script src="app.tsx"></script>
</html>
```

```typescript
// react-redux-app/app.tsx - a barebones react-redux application
const DEFAULT_STATE = { count: 0 }
function reducer (state = DEFAULT_STATE, action: any) {
  // ...
}

export const App = connect(
  state => state,
  dispatch => ({
    inc: () => dispatch({ type: INC }),
    dec: () => dispatch({ type: DEC })
  })
)((props: any) => (
  <div>
    {props.count}
    <button onClick={props.dec}>-</button>
    <button onClick={props.inc}>+</button>
  </div>
))

export const ConnectedApp = ({ store }: { store: Store }) => (
  <Provider store={store}>
    <App />
  </Provider>
)

export const createAppStore = (initialState: any) =>
  createStore(reducer, initialState)

if (isNode) {
  // render an html page in the server process,
  // and the react application to string from within
} else {
  const appNode = document.getElementById('app')
  ReactDOM.hydrate(
    <ConnectedApp store={createAppStore((window as any).INITIAL_STATE)} />,
    appNode
  )
}
```

```typescript
// react-redux-app/server.ts
const ENTRY_FILENAME = path.resolve(__dirname, 'index.html')
async function start () {
  const outFile = path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist', 'index.html')
  const app = new Koa()
  const outDir = path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist')
  // create a ui application bundler
  const options = {
    outDir,
    outFile,
    watch: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development',
    minify: process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'development',
    scopeHoist: false,
    hmr: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development',
    detailedReport: false
  }
  const bundler = new Bundler(ENTRY_FILENAME, options)
  bundler.bundle()
  const staticMiddleware = serveStatic(outDir)
  const isomorphicRenderMiddleware = createMiddleware({
    bundler,
    renderHtmlMiddleware: async (ctx, next) => {
      // stream the html file, but with react/redux data spliced in
      // parcel has already compiled our app now, and has
      // a fancy _proper_ html entrypoint at outFile, which has all of our original
      // html + comments, but modified to point to built assets (e.g. js files,
      // versus tsx files). serve that html asset, with redux state _and_
      // a stringified react => html tree!
      const outFileBuffer = await fs.readFile(outFile)
      const [preHeadClose, postHeadClose ] = outFileBuffer.toString()
        .split(/<!--.*head-content.*-->/)
      const [ preAppEntry, postAppEntry ] = postHeadClose
        .split(/<!--.*ssr-content.*-->/)
      ctx.status = 200
      const htmlStream = new CombinedStream()
      const initialState = { count: 99 } // you'd probably do something more interesting here
      ;[
        preHeadClose,
        // send the initial state date to the browser, so it can use it for hydration
        `<script>window.INITIAL_STATE = ${JSON.stringify(initialState)}</script>`,
        preAppEntry,
        // render react's html using our desired initial state
        ReactDOMServer.renderToNodeStream(ConnectedApp({ store: createAppStore(initialState) })),
        postAppEntry
      ].map(content => htmlStream.append(content))
      ctx.body = htmlStream
      ctx.type = 'html'
      await next()
    },
    staticMiddleware
  })
  app.use((ctx, next) => {
    return isomorphicRenderMiddleware(ctx, next)
  })
  app.listen(3000)
}
start()
