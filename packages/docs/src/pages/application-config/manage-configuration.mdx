# manage configuration

there are seemingly inifinite ways to manage configuration.  i generally recommend
conforming to [12 factor](https://12factor.net/config) recommendations. however, rather
than putting environment variable checks all over your code, prefer a pure and
testable strategy.

* create a configuration data-structure on boot, e.g. a `Config` object
* pass [slices of] configuration deeper into your application as needed
* attempt to keep your configuration consolidated/centralized
* attempt to keep your configuration immutable/read-only
* validate configuration (i.e. user input) each time it is created/replaced

when configuration is managed as suggested, you will not need advanced or
complicated local testing strategies.  simply create configuration (or any resource, really)
then pass the resource into modules being tested. this is also often considered
functional [dependency injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection).
