# perform basic routing

[koa-router](https://github.com/ZijianHe/koa-router) is the defacto router for koa.

define some routes, then use `.routes()` to create a middleware from the router builder.
`router.createMiddleware()` probably would have
been a better method name, but we can't win them all.
