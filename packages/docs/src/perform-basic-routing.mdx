# perform basic routing

[koa-router](https://github.com/ZijianHe/koa-router) is the defacto router for koa.

define some routes, then use `.routes()` to create a middleware from the router builder.
`router.createMiddleware()` probably would have
been a better method name, but we can't win them all.

```typescript
import Router from 'koa-router'
// ...
const app = new Koa()
var router = new Router();
router.get('/hello', ctx => ctx.body = 'world')
router.post('/beep', () => console.log('bop'))
app.use(router.routes())
app.listen(3000)
// curl localhost:3000/hello # => "world"
// curl -X POST localhost:3000/beep # => 404, logs "bop"
```
