# getting started

start a new project, and install the barebones.

it is assumed that you already have [nodejs](https://nodejs.org) installed.
i also use [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com), but feel free to use the package
manager of your choice (`npm` is bundled with nodejs).


```sh
# create a project directory
mkdir /app && cd /app
# initialize your VCS of choice
git init
# initiaze the package manager and install koa
yarn init -y
yarn add koa
# optionally add typescript
yarn add --dev typescript @types/koa
npx tsc --init
```
