cowtown is a guide to designing web applications.
cowtown is not about code.  rather, it is about enabling value streams through code,
ideally via functional composition, but not rigorously so.

cowtown is not a framework.  quite the opposite--this project aims to show you that
existing, accessible, open middlewares can provide unmatched value.  it's about showing
that middlewares are easy to link together, and how deep understanding and simplicity can be
achieved in a server-side web program when using a select few tools strategically.

cowtown delivers value through [koa](https://koajs.com).  koa does little on its own,
making its docs short and sweet.  even though koa is not batteries included
(i.e. it does little for you on its own), koa does offer a wonderful
request/response context object, which i will use heavily.

graze the koa docs. afterwards,  come back for some pragmatic, hands-on examples.
