# logging

**a logging provider should be created as early as possible in your application**

given the cross-cutting concern of logging, it's highly like that your imperative
entry script and fresh resources may have log content to share with the user.
create it early.

like all functional programming application resources,

**pass the logging resource to all consumers via function arguments**

other languages, such as python, support a system level logger.
such system level loggers, whilst convenient, are also highly stateful and subject
to unexpected mutation by consumers.  further, doing direct resource imports,
e.g. `import { logger } from './logger'`, has debatably harmful costs--such as
forcing you to mock or override default runtime behavior in things like tests,
where you may not care to see log output.

**consider a standard log schema & easily parseable format**

the most commonly selected format is [ndjson](http://ndjson.org). this will be
particularly helpful if you plan to use a logging aggregator--parsing will be very simple.
i like to configure my logger to log in `ndjson` in non-dev environments, and pretty print
logs during development.

the following example does not consider:

- what content to log
- what logging provider to use

that's up to you, friend.


> application logging

```typescript
// src/bin
const config = createConfig(...)
const logger = createLogger(config.logging)

// observe the logger shared between server, middlewares, and services
const server = await createServer({ config, logger })
const services = await createBackgroundServices({ config, logger })

// src/server
// ...
async function createServer ({ config, logger }) {
  const app = new Koa()
  const mw = await createMiddlewares({ config, logger })
  app.use(mw)
  return app
}

// src/middleware/cool-mw
function createCoolMw ({ logger }) {
  logger.debug('creating cool middleware')
  return (ctx, next) => {
    logger.warn('(⌐■_■) ( •_•)>⌐■-■ (•_•)')
    await next()
    logger.info('(•_•) ( •_•)>⌐■-■ (⌐■_■)')
  }
}

// src/util/widget
const debug = require('debug')('widget')
function buildWidget (pieces) {
  // library-esqe code is fine to log from,
  // but generally **should't use an application-level
  // logger**. consider modules like `debug`, or
  // conditional console logging instead.  be weary
  // of coupling libary code to application code and accidentally
  // reducing portability of your work.
  debug(`received ${pieces.length} pieces`)
  // or
  if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development') {
    console.info(`received ${pieces.length} pieces`)
  }
  return pieces.map(piece => piece.name).join('-')
}
```
